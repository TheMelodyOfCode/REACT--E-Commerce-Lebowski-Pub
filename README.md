# Tribute-to-Lebowski-pub-and-Movie
### REACT-MySQL-Firebase

#### Lebowski Pub & The Big Lebowski Movie
> This is a fully fictional project to learn React in combination with MySql and Firebase </br>
> The idea was to pay tribute to an awesome movie and the Theme Pub (Lebowski) former located in Edinburgh.</br>
> Unfortunately this pub doesn't exist anymore due to corona ... but the memory prevails :-) </br>


#### Firebase
> In the MySQL & Firebase Files - Folder, -you will find a MySQL file to import </br>
>> and a shop-data.js file for Firebase db in case you want to create your own.</br>
>> The current configuration in the firebase.utils file works though.</br>
>> In case that I will delete the db from firebase one day , I suggest to create your own, </br>
>> with the provided file </br>


#### Webserver - MySQL
> There is a webserver that runs on port 3001 </br>
>> I suggest you use XAMPP. - create a db and import the MySQL file. </br>
>> Make sure to check your configuration under server/database/dbConnection.js  </br>
>> If neccessary, change the routes under server/routes/dbRoutes.js</br>
>> Run the webserver first from the main folder - npm start


#### Create React APP
> Run the app from the client folder - npm start


#### Dokumentation
> There is a documentation folder with information about certain concepts</br>
>> Firebase, React Router, User-Context & general information.</br>


#### Dataflow
> In general the information within the code could have been better (i know )
> You will find a mind map in the documentation folder</br>
> The software to open the mindmap is free - (Wondershare EdrawMind) </br>
> This will help you:</br>
>> - To get an overview on how the website works</br>
>> - How components are connected</br>
>> - Imports to components </br>
