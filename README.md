# Tribute-to-Lebowski-pub-and-Movie
### REACT-MySQL-Firebase


> This is a fully fictonal project to learn React in combination with MySql and Firebase (yes 2 DBs) </br>
> The idea was to pay tribute to an awesome Movie and the Theme Pub (Lebwoski) former located in Edinburgh.</br>
> unfortunately this pub doesn't exist anymore due to corona but the memory prevails :-) </br>
> Since this is a fully fictional project not made for use in public.
> I'm not going to write a full getting started readme. </br>
> There is a documentation folder with md-files to get a rough idea</br>
> If you are really interested on how the website works in terms of Dataflow etc. there is a mind map in the documentation folder</br>
> The software to open the mindmap is free (Wondershare EdrawMind) </br>


> I laso want to give credit to **Andrei Neagoie** & especially to **Yihua Zhang** </br>
> I have learnd **so much** from them and I can highly recommend their teaching methods. </br>
