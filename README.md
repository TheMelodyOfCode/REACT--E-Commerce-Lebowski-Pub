### REACT-MySQL-Firebase

#### Tribute to Lebowski Pub & The Big Lebowski Movie
> This is a fully fictional project to learn React in combination with MySql and Firebase </br>
> The idea was to pay tribute to an awesome movie and the Theme Pub (Lebowski) former located in Edinburgh.</br>
> Unfortunately this pub doesn't exist anymore due to corona ... but the memory prevails :-) </br>


#### Firebase
> In the MySQL & Firebase Files - Folder, -you will find a MySQL file to import </br>
>> There is a shop-data.js file for Firestore db in case you want to create your own.</br>
>> The current configuration in the firebase.utils file works though.</br>
>> Just in case that I delete the db from firebase one day , I suggest to create your own, </br>
>> with the provided file </br>


#### Testserver - MySQL
> There is a test-server that runs on port 3001 </br>
>> I suggest you use XAMPP. - create a db and import the MySQL file. </br>
>> Make sure to check your configuration under server/database/dbConnection.js  </br>
>> If neccessary, change the routes under server/routes/dbRoutes.js</br>
>> Run the webserver first from the main folder - npm start</br>


#### React APP
> Run the app from the client folder - npm start</br>
> Runs on localhost:3000</br>


#### VPN - Proxy (possible error)
> In case you get the following Error:  
> Invalid options object. Dev Server has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema.    
 - options.allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string.  
> make sure to turn your proxy or vpn off 




#### Documentation
> There is a documentation folder with information about certain concepts</br>
>> Firebase, React Router, User-Context & general information.</br>


#### Dataflow
> You will find a mind map in the documentation folder</br>
> The software to open the mindmap is free - (Wondershare EdrawMind) </br>
> This will help you:</br>
>> - To get an overview on how the website works</br>
>> - How components are connected</br>
>> - Which imports to components have been made </br>
