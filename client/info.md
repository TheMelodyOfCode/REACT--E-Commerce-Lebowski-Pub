### React Router DOM
<br>
React Router has a web version and a nativ version.
Nativ is used for Nativ Apps.<br>
Here we work with the web version which has 2 technologies to offer.
BrowserRouter and HashRouter.
<br>
**HashRouter** doesn't reload the page but instead jumps to marked points
and triggers the hashchange-event.
<br>
**BrowserRouter** works with the HTML5-History-Api and uses to important methods.
pushState-method and popstate-event.
The user gets the impression that he has changed the page.
<br>
npm i react-router-dom
