#### Fragment
a Fragemnt is a component that renders to nothing when it gets mounted on the DOM.
Since we need a parent html element to render it is usfull if we don't want a div
wrapped around our code. shorthand is <> </> (no need to import Fragment with the shorthand)

#### SVG images
In order to use vector scaled images we need to import them as ReactComponent.
import { ReactComponent as MySVGLogo} from './path/to/MySVGLogo'<br>
<MySVGLogo/><br>
