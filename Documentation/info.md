a Fragemnt is a component that renders to nothing when it gets mounted on the DOM.
Since we need a parent html element to render it is usfull if we don't want a div
wrapped around our code.

#### Link
Link is essential an anker-tag that takes the installed BrowserRouter and routes to the specific place.
we utelized the link component in order to lavraged proper routing.<br>

import { ReactComponent as MySVGLogo} from './path/to/MySVGLogo'<br>
